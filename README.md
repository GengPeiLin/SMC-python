# SMC-python
Python codes for Sequential Monte Carlo sampling Technique. 

This technique is robust in sampling close to 1000-dimensions posterior probability 
densities.

Uses `numpy`, `scipy` and `collections` libraries. 

## Demonstration 
### Example 1: Bivariate bimodal Gaussian probability density
